# DFR
# This feedback reporting system takes user data from a particular testing administration and represents it in report format.
# Unfortunately, this is not entirely reproducible because I am unable to share confidential candidate testing information.
# If you, however, supply the correct information into the files, you will produce an output similar to the example one
# found in this folder.
